Total Points: 40


Part 1 [15 points, uses BankAccount.java]

	•	If we wanted to add a new member data field that would be used to store the interest that is applied to the account, which data type should we use?
    You could use a double.



Part 3 [5 points] 
	•	What output, if any, would be produced by the following code snippets? You should figure this out by hand, do not run them on a computer, please show your thought process.
	•	 
for (int i=3; i>=7; i++) { 
System.out.println(i); 
}

Starting from the number 3 this program should print out numbers up untill 7.  the variable i that we are comparing to is initially set to 3, the test case is while i is less than 7
and i++ incriments i by 1 every run through of the loop.













	•	
int x = 1; 
for (int k=24; k>0; k=k-x) { 
System.out.println(k); 
x++; 
}
